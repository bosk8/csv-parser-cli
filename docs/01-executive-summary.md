# Executive Summary

## Project Overview
**CSV Parser UI** is a web-based interface for a lightweight CSV parsing and filtering tool. The system provides a browser-native implementation that replicates the functionality of a C++ CLI utility, enabling users to upload CSV files, apply column-based filters with multiple operators, and export filtered results.

## Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Feature Parity**: Provide web UI equivalent to CLI functionality
   - CSV file upload and parsing
   - Column-based filtering with 7 operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, contains)
   - Filtered results display and CSV export

2. **Brand Consistency**: Adhere strictly to Bosk8 Dark Minimal Mono design system (`style.md`)
   - High-contrast dark theme
   - Monospace typography (JetBrains Mono)
   - Utilitarian, precise, engineering-first aesthetic

3. **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - High contrast ratios

4. **Performance**: Client-side processing for immediate feedback
   - No backend dependencies
   - Fast parsing of typical CSV sizes (1000+ rows)

### Secondary Objectives
- Responsive design (mobile-first, scales to desktop)
- Clear error messaging and validation feedback
- Intuitive workflow with progressive disclosure

## Primary Personas

### Persona 1: Data Analyst (Primary)
- **Role**: Regular CSV data analysis
- **Tech Proficiency**: Intermediate
- **Context**: Needs quick filtering without opening spreadsheet software
- **Goals**: Upload CSV, filter by column condition, export results
- **Pain Points**: CLI tools are too technical; spreadsheet apps are overkill
- **Key Use Case**: Filter customer data by age range, location, or salary

### Persona 2: Developer/Engineer (Secondary)
- **Role**: Quick data inspection or testing
- **Tech Proficiency**: Advanced
- **Context**: Familiar with CSV format and filtering concepts
- **Goals**: Fast, reliable filtering with exact operator control
- **Pain Points**: Needs precise control over filter operators
- **Key Use Case**: Validate CSV data, test filter conditions

## Major User Flows

### Flow 1: Successful Filter (Happy Path)
1. User visits application
2. User clicks file input → selects CSV file
3. System parses CSV, extracts headers
4. Filter section appears with column dropdown populated
5. User selects column index
6. User selects operator (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, contains)
7. User enters filter value
8. User clicks "APPLY"
9. System filters data client-side
10. Results section displays filtered CSV (header + matching rows)
11. User clicks "EXPORT CSV" → downloads filtered results

### Flow 2: Empty Results
1. Steps 1-8 from Flow 1
2. Filter returns zero matching rows
3. Results section shows header row only (mirrors CLI behavior)
4. Export still works (exports header-only CSV)

### Flow 3: Error States
- **Invalid column index**: Error message displayed, results show header only
- **File parse error**: Error message, filter section remains hidden
- **Empty file**: Error message, no filter section

### Flow 4: Operator-Specific Flows
- **Numeric operators (>, <, >=, <=)**: Validates numeric data, handles non-numeric gracefully
- **String operators (==, !=, contains)**: Case-sensitive matching
- **Edge cases**: Quoted fields with commas, empty rows, special characters

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Client-side only**: No backend API; all processing in browser JavaScript
- **File size limits**: Browser memory constraints (typical max ~100MB for file input)
- **Browser compatibility**: Modern browsers with FileReader API support
- **No persistence**: No server-side storage of uploaded files or results

### Design Constraints
- **Style.md compliance**: All visual decisions must reference `style.md` tokens
- **No new tokens**: Only derive from existing tokens, log derivations
- **Monospace requirement**: All UI text uses JetBrains Mono
- **Dark theme only**: No light mode (not in `style.md`)

### Functional Constraints
- **Single filter**: One filter condition per session (matches CLI limitation)
- **No multi-column filtering**: Sequential filtering requires re-upload or manual editing
- **No sorting/pagination**: Results display as continuous CSV text (mirrors CLI output)
- **No editing**: Results are read-only; export required for modifications

## Assumptions

1. **CSV Format**: First row is always treated as header
2. **Column Indexing**: Zero-based (0, 1, 2, ...)
3. **Empty Lines**: Skipped during parsing (matches C++ behavior)
4. **Quote Handling**: Basic quote-aware parsing (handles commas in quoted fields)
5. **Numeric Comparison**: Attempts numeric conversion; falls back to string comparison
6. **Result Format**: Always includes header row, even for empty results
7. **Export Format**: Plain CSV with comma separators, no special formatting

## Open Questions

1. **File Size Feedback**: Should we display file size warnings for very large files?
   - **Resolution**: Add file size display on upload (derived token: `--text-dim`)

2. **Result Count Display**: Should we show number of matching rows?
   - **Resolution**: Add subtle row count indicator (derived from `--text-subtle`)

3. **Operator Tooltips**: Should operators have help text explaining behavior?
   - **Resolution**: Use existing tooltip pattern for operator dropdown

4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Should we add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Enter to apply)?
   - **Resolution**: Add Enter key support on filter form (accessibility enhancement)

5. **Multiple File Sessions**: Should we support multiple files in same session?
   - **Resolution**: Current design supports only one file at a time (matches CLI)
